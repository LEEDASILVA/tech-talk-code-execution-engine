# What is Code execution engine

<br>

### Code execution engine (CEE) is a service that interprets and executes programming code written in various programming languages.

Some key aspects :

- 🛡️ **Isolation**
- 🎛️🔢 **Version Control**
- 📚🔗 **APIs and Integrations**
- 🛠️ **Language Support**
- 🔒 **Security**
- 💾 **Resource Management**
- 🏞️ **Execution Environment**
- 🪅 **Others...**
<!--
To describe Piston we will start by describing what is a code execution engine. So a code execution engine is a service that interprets and executes code written in any programming language.

The main task is to provide an environment in which code can be executed safely and efficiently.
The primary purpose of a Code Execution Engine is to run user code securely and with some kind of reliability.

As you can see we have here some key aspects that a code execution engine should have.

- Isolation : providing isolation will ensure that the executed code cannot harm the system or other running processes
- Version Control: Some code execution engine might support multiple programming language versions.
- APIs and Integrations: Allow the use of this feature in other software like online code editors.
- Language Support: allow multiple programming languages (compiled, functional and so on)
- Security: This one is imported, if not the most imported one. The engine needs to be secure while running code, because sometimes the code can be extraordinarily hostile and harmful.
- Resource Management: Also an imported aspect, because running code can take a lot of resources, and if it is bad code it can be even worse. So we need a good way to manage the system resources
- Execution Environment: We need a runtime environment for each code execution, which includes loading necessary libraries, providing standard input/output stream also handling errors on runtime.

# What is Piston?

code execution engine

<br>

## Piston is a high performance code execution engine that can be used to run source code on the web.

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true">
